# ExoSense Data IO Schema

**Document Status:** Version 3.0

## Introduction

This document defines the information required to interface with ExoSense™️ from the “first mile” perspective of the connected device or gateway, as well as describing how this information is carried on into the “last mile” or client-side Application.

This document is meant for device developers building native support into the device or a proxy/gateway service for connection to ExoSense via an IoT service and for those looking to gain a deeper understanding of the architecture of channels and signals in the ExoSense environment. It is not required for typical regular use of the ExoSense application itself.

**Who is this for:** This document is meant for developers building device software to interact with ExoSenseand/or contributing to the development of ExoSense and related technologies.

It is not required for regular use of the ExoSense application itself, although may be helpful for creating end-user documentation.

### Definitions

The reader of this document should have a grasp on the following items or will need to for this document to make sense.

| Term | Description | More Information |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Murano | IoT Platform | [Murano Docs](https://docs.exosite.com) |
| ExoSense™️ | Industrial IoT Application solution created and offered by Exosite | [Exosite](https://github.com/exosite/industrial_iot_schema/tree/a1c299fa81eb1cbfc81a8a91e58371fc91388b9b/exosite.com) |
| Device/Gateway | An electronic device with an IP Connection sending data to a platform.  In this case is interacing with directly connected sensors, custom protocol connected sensors, or fieldbus connected equipment |  |
| Sensors | Physical sensors connected to a Device/Gateway via wired or wireless protocol or IO \(onboard\).  Sensors are typically specific to a unit of measure - e.g. temperature, pressure, etc. |  |
| Channel | An ExoSense concept to identify an **individual stream** of information sent to ExoSense by an **unique device** that is specific to a type and with a specific unit of measure from that local physical environment \(e.g. Temperature or Valve 1 status\).  Can also be information such as memory on the device, status information, etc. | Typically a device is sending many channels of data for all of the sensors that are connected. |
| Signal | An ExoSense concept similiar to channel but is the part of a virtual Asset object that describes and stores the data.  Signals can be transformed, exported, visualzied, and have rules ran on them.  The source for a signal is typically a device channel but doesn't have to be.  The signal essentially subscribes to it's source. |  |
| Asset | An ExoSense concept for digitizing an Asset \(a machine, system, equipment, etc\) |  |
| Fieldbus | Industrial protocols like Modbus TCP or RTU, J1939, CANOpen, etc that allow machines, controls, equipment to have a standard way to talk to each other. |  |

## IoT Platform Device Interface Configuration Requirements

ExoSense uses the Murano IoT Platform device interface for it's device connectivity. The following information details the specific resources used \(HTTP resources / MQTT topics\) regardless of the transport protocol \(MQTT or HTTP\).

_Note: This document does not cover most details of how to interact with Murano’s IoT product/device interfaces including how to provision a device inside of a product defined in Murano, how to communicate with the_ [_HTTP_](http://docs.exosite.com/reference/products/device-api/http/) _or_ [_MQTT_](http://docs.exosite.com/reference/products/device-api/mqtt/) _APIs or other topics covered in_ [_Murano’s public documentation_](https://docs.exosite.com)_._

**Device resource use is as follows:**

| Resource Name | ExoSense Status | Who Can Write To | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `data_in` | supported | Device | Used to send data from device to cloud in the format defined in [Device Data Transport Schema](channel-signal_io_schema.md#device-data-transport-schema) section below |
| `config_io` | supported | Device / App | Used to share the complete configuration for a channels in the product.  This should be a 2-way synchronization meaning in the case of a self-configuring gateway, this would be written to by the gateway.  In a gateway that requires manual configuration from the application, this would be read by the gateway and cached locally. |
| `data_out` | supported | App | Used to send control requests from cloud to device in format defined in [Device Data Transport Schema](channel-signal_io_schema.md#device-data-transport-schema) section below |
| `config_applications` | supported | Device / App | Specifies configuration for the interfaces used by gateway protocol/fieldbus applications \(i.e. “interface = /dev/tty0”\) |
| `config_oem` | _reserved_ | tbd | Settings for product names, and limits that constrain/override communications or collections of data per the manufacturers/OEMs requirements |
| `config_interfaces` | _reserved_ | tbd |  |
| `config_rules` | _reserved_ | tbd |  |
| `config_network` | _reserved_ | tbd |  |

_Note: Generally do not recommend using custom resources with prefix of `config_`._

## Device / Gateway Channel Configuration Schema

### Configuration Overview

This section defines the Channel Configuration object \(sometimes called a device or gateway template\). This is the 'contract' for each individual device as to what channels of data it will be sending and optionally be controlling. The concept is data used by ExoSense flows as **Channels** to and from devices. These device channel sources can then be mapped to digital twin Asset signals in the ExoSense application.

A gateway or device will require some level of configuration in order to do several things:

1. Know what information to read off of / write to a fieldbus or IO

2. Translate that information from machine-readable and terse input to Murano, back into contextual and human readable data ready to be taken into ExoSense - i.e. a signal object
3. Provides a consistent way for standardizing interfaces so that analytic apps downstream are able to consume this common data type.

Of note for this section - the channel \(io\) configuration will be stored in the config\_io product resource for the device as defined in Section 2 of this document. The value in that resource will be considered the source of truth for the shared gateway configuration. Meaning if a gateway is re-configured manually at the gateway, or if it is a gateway that is auto-configured by discovering the devices connected to it, the updated value must be pushed to that resource before RCM will become aware of any changes.

The configuration below wraps a user-defined value with a ${...}, and other names/keys are meant to be an exact match that will be used by ExoSense. Some values for a key are filled in with example strings - noted with an “e.g.”.

### Channel identifiers

Channel identifiers must be unique to the device context, in the device's config\_io and recommend using no special characters or spaces, but must be a valid string. ExoSense uses a `"###"` scheme starting at `"001"`. For devices that hard code their configuration and are not remotely configurable, any string can be used and can be more descriptive \(e.g. "humidity"\). Identifiers are not made viewable by users of the application, the display name is what users will see.

### Data types / units

The data type definitions are detailed below. Each channel has a unique type and unit tied to the channel identifier that can not be changed after set. The ExoSense application UI will not allow this. Technically a device could overwrite a channel type, but this will have unknown consequences and will likely result in signals not functioning properly. Information about primitive types is also in the Data Types Definition section.

Data types and units for channels and signals are defined in the [ExoSense™️ Channel and Signal Data Types](data-types.md) document.

### Display Name and Description

Used by the application to show the user a friendly name and description \(optional\) of the channel, which will provide them with better context to help map to asset signals.

### Locked channels

The 'locked' property is not required and is optional for use. The entire configuration can be locked or channels can invidivually be locked. If not set, defaults to 'false'. A locked channel means that it is read-only on the application side. Assumes the coniguration \(config\_io\) has been set by the device and the device has no ability to take action based on changes on the application / cloud side.

Locked channels and full configurations generally are used by devices that have a hard coded configuration, the channels are all defined and the config\_io is uploaded by the device. Devices can use a combination of locked and configurable channels, thus why the locked field can be found at both the full config level and per channel.

### Report Rate

The interval for the device to report values to the cloud \(ExoSense\). May be used in the application to determine gaps in data.

### Timeout

The interval that is considered a timeout for a channel. Can be the same as report rate but typically set at a larger interval to provide room for network slowness and reconnections. Typically not used by the device but used by an Asset signal in the application to generate timeout events for the asset / device UI's, timeout events in the asset logs, and future possibilities. _E.g. The device reports a channel every 1 minute but if it hasn't reported for 5 minutes, this is an event that may need to have a call to action for._ 

### Control Channels

Channels can also be used to 'control' a device. A simple example of this is to turn on/off a valve. By default channels are not enabled to be controlled, but by setting the `control` property to `true`, ExoSense and the device will allow for sending commands from the application to the device. A control channel uses all of the same schema in this document and devices must write the last state to the `data_in` resource, but the use of control channels requires the additional use of `data_out` resource. [More details below](channel-signal_io_schema.md#device-control-interface) on the proper use and flow of control data.

### Protocol configuration

Optionally used by the device to determine what application \(protocol / interface\) will be used and the specific details to get / set the information for the channel. Used for fieldbus protocols \(e.g. Modbus RTU\) or custom applications such as a custom wireless handler or one that gathers data from local I/O on the hardware. The protocol configuration parameters are optional to use, devices that are not configurable may not use this at all and therefore would not be specified.

Devices that are configurable should use the protocol configuration properties to get / set data, convert it, and determine how often to sample \(read locally\) and report \(to cloud\).

#### Additional Channel Edge Conversion Handling
The following parameters are available for device firmware to use to do edge side processing of the data from a sensor or input before sending up to ExoSense.   These are all optional and require the device to support.  

##### Report on Change
The `report_on_change` parameter, if used and set to True, device firmware should only report channel values if different than the last time it received a value.  Typically devices would also send on boot-up and may have more advanced algorithm for when it chooses to report a value.

##### Down Sample
If used, the `down_sample` parameter provides the device with information about how to handle the situation where a channel input is sampled many times over a given time period before (sample vs report rates) reported.  This allows a user to decide how to down sample the values before reporting.  Options are: Min, Max, Average, or Actual which would require the device to choose a value to send (last, first, etc).  

##### app_specific_config
Is an object that can contain custom parameters (key/value pairs) defined by the device firmware developer to be used by the protocol application.

```JSON
${app_specific_config_item1} : "${app_config_item1_value}"
${app_specific_config_item2} : "${app_config_item2_value}"
```
##### Edge Raw Input Conversion Parameters
`min`, `max`, and `unit` under the `input_raw` object should be used for applications where the device converts raw sampled data before reporting.  
**For edge mapping conversion:**
`protocol_config.input_raw.min` and `protocol_config.input_raw.max` should be combined with the `properties.min` and `properties.max` for mapping conversion.
**For edge unit conversion**
`protocol_config.input_raw.unit` can be used with `properties.data_unit` for edge side unit conversion. 
**For edge scale and offset conversion**
The `protocol_config.multiplier` and `protocol_config.offset` parameters can be used by the device firmware for edge sample conversion.  


Advanced use only for allowing for server side conversion of data. Not supported for normal ExoSense application use. Not recommended. Must not be used by the device.

### IoT Properties

Advanced use only for allowing for server side conversion of data. Not supported for normal ExoSense application use. Not recommended. Must not be used by the device.

### Device Channel to Asset Signal Configuration relationship

Signals inherit channel properites once created in the application. Once a signal has been created through, changes to the channel's configuration do not automatically get applied to the signal's properties. A signals properties, such as 'timeout', can be changed \(if the application allows for it\), but will not result in a change back down to the device channel.

## Channel Data Schema

Having a common shared channel configuration \(a contract essentially\) between the device and the cloud/application allows us to keep the actual data sent between devices and the cloud to a minimum - focusing only on the sending of values for channels rather than unnecessary configuration information that rarely changes.

The resource used for writing channel values from devices to the cloud/application is “data\_in”, as mentioned in the resource section.

There are 3 different scenarios of how we might want to send data - each one should build on the other, and they are:

**Single Data Value**

This is a very simple signal\_id = value approach, but encoded in JSON.

```javascript
{ "${device_channel_id1}" : "${current_channel_value}" }
```

**Multiple signals written in a single payload**

```javascript
{
  "${device_channel_id1}" : "${current_channel_value1}",
  "${device_channel_id2}" : "${current_channel_value2}",
  "${device_channel_id3}" : "${current_channel_value3}",
  "${device_channel_id7}" : "${current_channel_value7}"
}
```

_Example with real data_

```javascript
{
  "001" : true,
  "002" : 78.233,
  "003" : {"lat":43.650883,"lng":-96.201642},
  "007" : "good"
}
```

This payload assumes each datapoint is to be recorded in the time series database at the time it is received.

_Note: Each channel is not required to send a value in each payload. Some payloads may have a few channels, some may just have one, others may have all channels_

**Multiple signals, with some repeating, with different timestamps in a single payload:**

Utilize the Record API from Murano, and apply the array of signals to each timestamps data.

[Murano Device Record API - HTTP](http://docs.exosite.com/reference/products/device-api/http/#record)

[Murano Device Record API - MQTT](http://docs.exosite.com/reference/products/device-api/mqtt/#report-data-to-historical-timestamps)

This requires that the clock be synced on the gateway to the global network time via ntp which is used by our servers in our cluster. Our recommendation will be that the ntp server syncs with the gateway at least once every time the power is cycled on the gateway, and once per 12-24 hours of continuous operation time.

### Channel Error Handling

_Optional use, not required_

_Not Currently Used by ExoSense_

When an error occurs for a signal, the payload will change by adding the protected keyword property `__error` to the JSON root object like so:

```javascript
{
  "${channel_id1}" : "${current_channel_value1}",
  "${channel_id2}" : "${current_channel_value2}",
  "${channel_id7}" : "${current_channel_value7}",
  "__error" : {
    "${channel_id1}" : "${error_message_or_code}",
    "${channel_id3}" : "${error_message_or_code}" 
  }
}
```

The error object is a list of keys of the channel ids with an error, and then the value of that property is the error message, error code, or concatenation of any useful information that can be formatted into a string.

_Note: the device can report a channel data payload, even if the data is erroneous, but that is optional. We will accept a chanel value and an error, just an error for a channel, or just a value. All combinations are supported._

## Device Control Interface

_Optional use, not required_

Application use cases that require ExoSense to control device actions, such as turning on/off a valve can use control channels. A control channel works and uses the same schema / format as regular channels. Data types, units, and other properties are all used exactly the same.

**Important Disclaimer**: _Device control from a remote server application requires common sense on what functionality and if a machine should actually be remotely controlled. It is assumed that those building devices and systems that support remote control will provide local override capabilties and safety measures. For example, if a device allows remote control of a garage door that there are physical sensors to sense and not allow a door to close if someone is in the way and ways to override the closing of the door at the physical location._

![Device Control](.gitbook/assets/control_interface_overview.png)

### Example channel configuration for control

In this example, there is a valve that the device will open / close based on the channel `004`.

```javascript
"004": {
  "display_name": "Valve Control",
  "description": "On / Off control",
  "properties": {
    "data_type": "BOOLEAN",
    "control": true
  },
  "protocol_config": {
    "report_rate": 60000,
    "timeout": 360000
  }
}
```

### Predefined control ranges and options

For channels that have a defined range of settings \(assuming a numeric type of channel\) or a set list of options, the configuration allows setting these ranges or options.

**Example Control Range** In this example for a thermostat type application, a range is provided of acceptable values. ExoSense will enforce allowing users to only set a value in this range.

```javascript
"009": {
  "display_name": "Thermostat Set Point",
  "description": "Set Point",
  "properties": {
    "data_type": "TEMPERATURE",
    "data_unit": "DEG_CELSIUS",
    "control": true
  },
  "control_properties": {
    "range": {
      "min": 20,
      "max": 40
    }
  },
  "protocol_config": {
    "report_rate": 60000,
    "timeout": 360000
  }

### Device Control Interface

![Device Channel Control Flow](.gitbook/assets/control_flow_diagram.png) Devices that will use control channels must begin subscribing \('mqtt'\) or polling \('http'\) the `data_out` resource. The data format is the same as `data_in` and any new data\_out value will contain one or more new control channel requests. The device must acknowledge it received the value by writing the same back to `data_out` \(Murano Device API requirement\) which tells the platform the value was received. After taking action on the control requests, the device must write the new channel states back to data\_in to close the loop so ExoSense knows the request finished.

**Device Steps:** 1. Subscribe or Poll `data_out` 2. On new `data_out` value, acknowledge received by writing back to `data_out` 3. Device takes control actions. 4. Device writes the channel states that were requested in `data_out` back to `data_in`

## Device Protocol Interfaces

_Optional use, not required_

This section defines the supported out of the box protocol interfaces and parameters. OEMs can use their own application and interface parameters also but may not be supported in the application user interface \(ExoSense\).

_Note: Only applicable to devices that are remotely configurable and use a fieldbus or fieldbus like configurable protocol for interacting with data / inputs / sensors._

### Modbus TCP

Parameters for a channel's protocol configuration 'app\_specific\_config' field when using Modbus\_TCP.

```yaml
    ip_address : "IP_ADDRESS" # ip where the channel is being read as a string
    port : "INTEGER" # port to make the request on
    register_range : ["HOLDING_COIL", "INPUT_COIL", "INPUT_REGISTER", "HOLDING_REGISTER"]
    register : "INTEGER" # 0001-9999
    register_count : "INTEGER" # 1, 2, 4, 8, ...
    byte_endianness" : [ "little", "big" ]
    register_endianness" : [ "little", "big" ]
    evaluation_mode : ["floating point: ieee754", "signed integer", "unsigned", "string-ascii"]               
    bitmask : "HEXADECIMAL" # hex value for bits to mask out/pass-thru
```

### Modbus RTU

Parameters for a channel's protocol configuration 'app\_specific\_config' field when using Modbus\_TCP.

    slave_id : "INTEGER" 
    register_range : ["HOLDING_COIL", "INPUT_COIL", "INPUT_REGISTER", "HOLDING_REGISTER"]
    register : "INTEGER" # 0001-9999
    register_count : "INTEGER" # 1, 2, 4, 8, ...
    byte_endianness" : [ "little", "big" ]
    register_endianness" : [ "little", "big" ]
    evaluation_mode : ["floating point: ieee754", "signed integer", "unsigned", "string-ascii"]               
    bitmask : "HEXADECIMAL" # hex value for bits to mask out/pass-thru
```

### CANopen

Parameters for a channel's protocol configuration 'app\_specific\_config' field when using CANopen.

```yaml
    node_id : "HEXADECIMAL" # e.g. "0x01"
    msg_index : "HEXADECIMAL"  # "PDO" starts at 0x180,"SDO" starts at 0x580, required
    offset : "INTEGER" # e.g. "0" bytes (determines starting byte position to read), default is 0, required
    data_length : "INTEGER" # e.g. "8" bytes (determines how many PDOs to read), default is 8, required
    evaluation_mode : [“REAL32”, “INT8”, “INT16”, “UINT16”, “UINT32”, “STRING”, “BOOLEAN”]
```

## Protocol Interface Application Configuration \(Optional\)

_Note: Optional use for remotely configurable devices._

The gateway / device applications that handle reading/writing for channels may have properties that need to be set that are useful for all channels using that protocol / interface. For example, 10 channels may be set up to use Modbus\_RTU at interface /dev/tty0. The application that handles the modbus communication needs to know the interface details such as baud rate, etc.

The resource used to hold this information that may then be communicated from cloud application to device is `config_applications`. This resource is used by the device to know what interfaces and other application configuration parameters the user has selected. These are not specific to the channel, but to the entire protocol application.

The application protocols and interfaces listed below are used in `config_io` and therefore are used to drive channel configuration options in the user application.

**Application Configuration \(`config_applications`\) Description**
